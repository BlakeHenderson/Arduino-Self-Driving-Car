Arduino Self Driving Car
=============================

This project was intended for a STEM competition in which a self driving vehicle would have to go around a track as many times
as possible in a certain period of time.

Using multiple sensors on each part of the car, the code would determine which way the servo motors would move steering
the vehicle left or right. 

This process was slow at first but to improve it, the arduino device could use machine learning to find a particular path 
around the track after detecting its surroundings.
